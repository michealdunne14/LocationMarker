## UX/DX
The UX/DX approach that is that I wanted to make it as simple to upload as possible. This can be achieved by uploading an image and let the app do the processing. I have a calendar view instead of entering in the date. The pager allows to simply move from fragment to fragment very easily. Never have to leave the main part of the app to add a new post.

## Personal Statement
The project will allow you to upload your images and the app will automatically find this location and be able to show you where this is without having to input the location yourself. The user can then view all posts on a map and filter by favourites.
